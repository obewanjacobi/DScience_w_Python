    "The Coursera course taught by the University of Michigan wasn't really doing it for me. So I decided to start from scratch with this handy notebook, where I will lay down the Python basics to remind myself how things work. Ideally this will help me in the longrun when taking the upper level courses for the University of Michigan's Data Science with Python (especially because they don't go into too much detail in the course). My work here will be based off of the lessons on the website www.learnpython.org. So without further ado, let's get started! (Note for Jacob: Ctrl-m m makes a Markdown cell.) \n",

It's also similar to the `sprintf()` function in R, that allows the user to use C-style string formatting commands. (Have you noticed I sprinkle a lot of R in here? It's my baby.) The `%` operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a \"tuple\" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with \"argument specifiers\", special symbols like `%s` and `%d`. Here's an example."
