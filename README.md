# DScience_w_Python

This repository contains my assignments and exploratory work for the "Introduction to Data Science in Python" course on Coursera from the University of Michigan.

Under the "teaching_myself" directory, there is a Jupyter Notebook that contains my exploratory work on Python, making a comprehensive introduction to the language that could ideally be used by anyone. The work is based around the tutorials given on www.learnpython.org.
